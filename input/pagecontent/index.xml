	<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
    Implementing an evidence-based clinical decision support quality improvement (QI) initiative to improve health centers in HIV prevention, diagnoses, care, and treatment to improve health outcomes. NACHC strategic approach will leverage existing informatics clinical decision support infrastructure both internally and externally to advance efforts of health centers to implement evidence-based strategies to end the HIV epidemic in their communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    NACHC and its partners are applying Human Centered Design Framework tools and strategies to develop a clinical decision support intervention that is care team and patient centric through:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      the use of EHR tools and technology
    </li>
    <li>
      iterative data submission
    </li>
    <li>
      harmonization of clinical, data, and measure workflow implementation strategies across the CDCâ€™s HIV care cascade clinical guidelines, and CDS tools that foster shared decision making
    </li>
  </ul>
